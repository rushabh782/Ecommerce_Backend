**DOMAIN** : BACKEND WEB DEVELOPMENT

**BATCH DURATION**: January 5th, 2025 to February 5th, 2025.

**MENTOR NAME** : NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

**DESCRIPTION of the E-commerce Backend System**
The E-commerce Backend System is a robust and scalable application developed using Node.js and Express.js as the primary backend framework. The system is designed to handle core functionalities such as user authentication, product management, and order processing, with MongoDB serving as the database. The application is structured to support seamless API interactions and has been thoroughly tested using Postman.

**Features Implemented:**

**1. User Authentication:**

Implemented secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Integrated bcrypt for password hashing, ensuring data security.
Created middleware to protect routes, enabling role-based access for users and admins.

**2. Product Management:**

Built CRUD operations for products, allowing admins to create, update, and delete products.
Designed endpoints to fetch all products and retrieve specific product details.
Integrated middleware to ensure only authorized users and admins can perform specific actions.

**3. Order Management:**

Developed the order schema to handle user orders, including product details, quantities, and total price.
Added functionality to create and retrieve orders.
Ensured secure access to order management using user authentication middleware.

**4.Error Handling and Validation:**

Integrated robust error-handling mechanisms for database operations.
Utilized Mongoose validation to ensure data integrity for users, products, and orders.
Defined custom error messages for common issues like missing fields or unauthorized access.

**5.API Testing with Postman:**

Designed and tested RESTful APIs for user, product, and order management.
Utilized Postman to simulate real-world scenarios and validate API functionality.
Configured headers to include JWT tokens for secured endpoints.

**6. Database:**

Used MongoDB as the NoSQL database for its flexibility and scalability.
Established a connection using mongoose and adhered to schema-based modeling for consistency.
Local MongoDB instance configured with a URL (mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ecommerceBackendDatabase).

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
Node.js: For building the backend server and handling asynchronous operations.
Express.js: To create RESTful APIs with clean and modular routing.
MongoDB: As the database for storing users, products, and orders.
Mongoose: For schema-based modeling and managing MongoDB interactions.
Postman: To test API endpoints and ensure proper functionality.
JWT: For secure user authentication and session management.
bcrypt: To hash and compare passwords securely.

**Challenges Faced:**
Debugged and resolved issues related to missing dependencies and module imports.
Addressed authentication errors, such as incorrect or missing JWT tokens.
Ensured seamless integration of user, product, and order functionalities with proper validation.

**Conclusion:**
The E-commerce Backend System is a well-structured application that incorporates modern tools and best practices for backend development. With a focus on scalability and security, the system can efficiently manage user authentication, product catalogs, and order processing. The use of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB ensures that the backend is highly adaptable and ready for further enhancements. Comprehensive API testing with Postman validates its functionality, making it a solid foundation for any e-commerce platform. Future extensions could include features like payment integration, advanced search capabilities, and detailed analytics dashboards.
